Paper Abstract
:	In this talk we presented a wearable Haptic Feedback Device to convey intuitive motion direction to the user through haptic feedback based on vibrotactile illusions. Vibrotactile illusions occur on the skin when two or more vibrotactile actuators in proximity are actuated in coordinated sequence, causing the user to feel combined sensations, instead of separate ones. By combining these illusions we can produce various sensation patterns that are discernible by the user, thus allowing to convey different information with each pattern. In this talk we introduced a method to provide information about direction through vibrotactile illusions. This method uses a grid of vibrotactile actuators around the arm actuated in coordination. The sensation felt on the skin is consistent with the desired direction of motion, so the desired motion can be intuitively understood.
