Paper Abstract
:	Handling fabric components is one of the most common and essential tasks in garment factories. For example, picking a single fabric part from its stack is frequently done for the manufacturing process. Many types of grippers have been developed so far for handling the fabric part. Parallel grippers, originally designed for grasping rigid objects, are often used to grasp fabric parts. Different types of grippers specialized for handling a fabric part have also been developed using pneumatic forces, pneumatic suction mechanism, electro-adhesion mechanism, needles penetrated into the fabric part, and so on. Power source is required to use these. We propose a novel solution for handling the fabric without using any actuators. All internal movements of the gripper are mechanically driven, eliminating the need for external power sources. Since the proposed gripper can be easily used simply by attaching it to a system, the gripper is expected to contribute to automation in a factory at a low cost.
