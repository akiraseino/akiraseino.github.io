Abstract
:	The goal of this research is to develop a system that recognizes the surrounding environment by the ultrasonic sensor in high resolution. In this study, the multiple signal classification (MUSIC) method is used to calculate the reflected wave's direction of arrival. However, the MUSIC method has a limitation of the number of arriving waves. In this research, the phased array transmitter is used to solve this problem. The transmitter emits directed ultrasonic beams to objects. We propose a system consists of an ultrasonic phased array transmitter and microphone array with the MUSIC method. The system is designed in which the number of emitted beams is less than the limit of the number of arriving waves. Finally, the experiment shows the can localize multiple objects simultaneously.
