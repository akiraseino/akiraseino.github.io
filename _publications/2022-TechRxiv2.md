Abstract
:	This paper proposes CNN-based visual servoing for simultaneous positioning and flattening of a soft fabric part placed on a table by a dual manipulator system. We propose a network for multimodal data processing of grayscale images captured by a camera and force/torque applied to force sensors. The training dataset is collected by moving the real manipulators, which enables the network to map the captured images and force/torque to the manipulatorâ€™s motion in Cartesian space. We apply structured lighting to emphasize the features of the surface of the fabric part since the surface shape of the non-textured fabric part is difficult to recognize by a single grayscale image. Through experiments, we show that the fabric part with unseen wrinkles can be positioned and flattened by the proposed visual servoing scheme.
