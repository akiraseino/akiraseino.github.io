In this compulsory third year course, students are taught the basics of mechanical draft including how to read and write, CAD system, and how to use machine tools. This lecture is divided into two parts. In the first half, students learn about mechanical draft by hand and using CAD software, and in the second half, they learn how machine parts are manufactured through practical training using machine tools. Safety training for machine tools is also an important part of the training.
