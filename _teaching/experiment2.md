Students attend our laboratory for 4 hours to perform a hands-on activity related to our field of research. In our case, the activity consisted in studying the Segmental Method to calculate the Center of Mass of the human body. After studying how to calculate it, we requested them to modify a program in Processing to display the calculated center of mass in a picture, and posteriorly in a video. I was in charge of the whole activity design.
