This year, we are hosting the 4th Iteration of the Tohoku Engineering Summer Program ([TESP](http://www.astro.mech.tohoku.ac.jp/TESP/)), where a group of foreign students from different Universities team up for about two weeks designing two different self-balancing robot using Lego Mindstorms, and on their last day, we have the two robots fight in a sumo ring.

The fight at the end is always very entertaining, and the students have a great time. You can see the final fight from 2018 in this video:
