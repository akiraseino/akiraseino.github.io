It's ROBOMECH time!

I had the opportunity to go and present our work in the Robotics and Mechatronics Conference 2017 in Fukushima (ROBOMECH 2017). We had a great time! Given the nature of ROBOMECH, which mainly consists on poster presentations, many researchers bring demos of their robots, which make this conference a super interest opportunity to observe up-close the latest advances in robotics research.

Right after the conference, we had a lab trip to The Aizu-Wakamatsu region. It was great! We had the opportunity to enjoy Onsen and go to Tsuruga Castle. Here's a pic of our Lab members at the Castle!
