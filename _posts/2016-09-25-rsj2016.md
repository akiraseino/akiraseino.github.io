Great news!
------

We had the opportunity to present our latest findings at the 34th Annual Conference of the Robotics Society of Japan (RSJ2016) in Yamagata! I was kind of nervous because my presentation was entirely in Japanese, but everything went alright. 

Yamagata was very good. The food was great, and the conference venue was Yamagata University, so it was a great chance to experience the environment of a different university in Japan. Even though not everyone was presenting at the conference, all members of our lab attended. It was a great experience for all of us.

We also had the opportunity to see a performance of Yamagata Maiko at the conference banquet. All in all, great experience!

Here's a picture of me with one of the Maiko! They were amazing!
