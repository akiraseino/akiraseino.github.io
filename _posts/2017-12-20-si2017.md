SI comes to Sendai
------

The SICE Symposium on System Integration (SI 2017) was held in the International Center, in Sendai. My advisor, Prof. Yasuhisa Hirata, was the General Chair, so besides presenting our work we also had the opportunity to help out with the logistics of organizing and running the conference.

I, along with several other students from our lab, presented our latest findings. It was so interesting attending a conference as a local! You don't need to stay in a hotel haha. I brought a demo of our haptic device, which gathered quite some interest among the attendees.
