It's official
------

My life as a Ph.D. student has come to an end. It feels great, as it was a goal that I had since I was a kid. I'm very thankful to everyone who supported me in this journey: God, my wife, my parents (both Japanese and Venezuelan), my advisor (and future boss) Prof. Yasuhisa Hirata, and all my labmates. I'm really glad that I managed to finish everything on time. 

For the time being, I'll remain in Academia. I was offered a position as an Assistant Professor at my Laboratory, so that means that I'll be doing basically the same, with added responsibilities, such as supervision of other projects, academic advisory and teaching. I hope everything goes well! 

I'm also very happy because my Venezuelan parents managed to come visit and made it in time for my Graduation Ceremony. I'm having the greatest time with them here, I wish they could stay longer! 

Anyways, here's a picture of me on the stage of the Graduation Ceremony.
