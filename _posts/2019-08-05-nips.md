I had the opportunity to attend a workshop at the National Institute for Physiological Sciences ([NIPS](https://www.nips.ac.jp/eng/)), in Okazaki, Japan. The workshop was titled "Multidisciplinary research on the development of brain functions and motion during the growth period of infants and children". It was very interesting, with talks ranging from robotics for welfare to rehabilitation specialists and brain specialists.

We had the opportunity to do a lab tour, where we saw NIPS facilities. For some of them, we had to wear protective gear, as they included experiments with animals.

It was my first time in the Aichi prefecture, so I tried the most famous food there, the [hitsumabushi](https://matcha-jp.com/en/1239) (which is an eel donburi with a rigurous eating procedure) and ironically, the Taiwan ramen (yeah, Taiwan ramen [is not Taiwanese](https://www.taberukoto.jp/ramen/taiwan-ramen-en/)). Both were delicious, highly recommend the Taiwan ramen!!
