My first international conference!
------

We had the opportunity to present our work at one of IEEE-RAS flagship conferences, the 2016 IEEE/RSJ International Conference on Intelligent Robots and Systems (IROS 2016) in Daejon, Korea. This was my first international conference, and I really enjoyed it!

We presented a paper titled "Motion Guidance using Haptic Feedback based on Vibrotactile Illusions". You can find more details about it [here](/talks/2016-iros).

During the conference, I was able to attend many impressive talks in various fields of robotics, as well as attend the autonomous drone competition. I had the chance to meet a lot of amazing people from Academia and Industry, and made very good friends with tons of people, including some amazing lads working at the Computer Vision department in Intel (the ones developing the Intel Real Sense!), who showed me some prototypes of the latest Real Sense iteration. Here's the IROS squad:

I also talked a bit with [Prof. Oussama Khatib](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oussama_Khatib) during the banquet, and thanked him for his lecture earlier this year at Tohoku University. He's a roboticist and a professor of computer science at Stanford University, famous for proposing the [artificial potential field method](https://cs.stanford.edu/groups/manips/publications/pdfs/Khatib_1986_IJRR.pdf) for facilitating robot motion planning. He's a great guy, very inspiring! I'd recommend everyone his course "Introduction to Robotics", available [for free at iTunes U](https://itunes.apple.com/us/itunes-u/introduction-to-robotics/id384233063?mt=10). Here's a picture of me with him and [Prof. Yoshida](http://www.astro.mech.tohoku.ac.jp/e/) from our university, who is known for projects such as the "Hayabusa" asteroid sample-return probe, which returned to earth in 2010.
