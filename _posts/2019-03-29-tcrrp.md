Prof. [Kazuhiro Kosuge](http://www.irs.mech.tohoku.ac.jp/kazuhirokosuge.html), 2019 IEEE Vice President-Elect for Technical Activities, invited me to take part into a new committee created in IEEE-RAS, called the Technical Committee on [Robotics Research for Practicality](https://www.ieee-ras.org/robotics-research-for-practicality). This TC was created to have a forum that facilitates discussions on the ways to address the challenges in the robotics research community to close the gap between research and industry.

As a preparation for our first workshop, scheduled for [IROS 2019](https://www.iros2019.org/), in Macau, we had the opportunity to meet one of our co-chairs, Prof. [Rodney Brooks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rodney_Brooks), the creator of huge companies such as [iRobot](https://www.irobot.com/) and [Rethink Robotics](https://www.rethinkrobotics.com/), in Tokyo. He was kind enough to let us tape a few words regarding Practicality, and the challenges ahead. Check it out!

After taping the video, we went to a restaurant at Tokyo Station to have some amazing tempura! Thank you for the great talk, Prof. Brooks :)
