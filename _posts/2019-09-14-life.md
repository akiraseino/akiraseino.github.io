LIFE 2019 in Tokyo
------

This week, I attended the 2019 Annual Symposium in Welfare Engineering (LIFE2019), which was held at Keio University, in Tokyo. This is a symposium jointly held by the Japan Society of Mechanical Engineers, Life Support Society, Japan Society for Life Support Engineering, where topics such as rehabilitation, biometrics and welfare engineering are discussed. A student of our lab presented his work on a cycling wheelchair.
