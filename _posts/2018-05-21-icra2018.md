There's good news, and bad news...
------

The good news is that our work was published in IEEE's distinguished journal [Robotics and Automation Letters](https://www.ieee-ras.org/publications/ra-l), as well as selected for presentation at the 2018 IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation ([ICRA 2018](http://www.icra2018.org/)) in Brisbane, Australia. This is amazing, because ICRA is the largest IEEE-RAS conference, and I was very excited to go!

Unfortunately, I'm quite busy finishing everything needed for my Ph.D. dissertation, so the second author will present the work. The contribution is titled "Path-Following Guidance Using Phantom Sensation Based Vibrotactile Cues Around the Wrist". You can find more details about it [here](/publications/2018-ral).
