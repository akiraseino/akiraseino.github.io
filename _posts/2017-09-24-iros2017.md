It's IROS time again!
------

We had the opportunity to present our work at the 2017 IEEE/RSJ International Conference on Intelligent Robots and Systems ([IROS 2017](https://www.iros2017.org/)) in Vancouver, Canada. IROS is one of IEEE-RAS flagship conferences, so this was very exciting. Additionally, the contribution we presented was published in IEEE's distinguished journal [Robotics and Automation Letters](https://www.ieee-ras.org/publications/ra-l). It was such a pleasure to be back in IROS!

The contribution we presented is titled "A phantom-sensation based paradigm for continuous vibrotactile wrist guidance in two-dimensional space". You can find more details about it [here](/publications/2017-ral).

This iteration of IROS was as impressive as the one on the prior year, and I had a great time. The venue, the Vancouver Convention Centre, was amazing, and the view was incredible, making coffee breaks even more enjoyable! Here's a picture of me during the banquet!
