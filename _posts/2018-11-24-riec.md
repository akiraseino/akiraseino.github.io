I had the chance to present a poster summarizing our research at the 2nd Tohoku-NTU University Symposium on Interdisciplinary AI and Human Studies at the Research Institute of Electrical Communication (RIEC), at Tohoku University, Japan. Great opportunity to hear different talks about diverse topics, particularly some that I am not much familiar with, such as genetics and content design.

We also had the chance to visit RIEC's electromagnetic anechoic chamber, which was impressive. Check it out in the picture below
