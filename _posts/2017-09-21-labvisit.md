We had the pleasure to receive Prof. Daniele Fontanelli, Associate Professor from the University of Trento, in Italy. He gave a very insightful talk, and then we went out for some local Tohoku region food and sake. 

Prof. Fontanelli's research is quite close to ours, so this opportunity enabled us to discuss about their latest findings, as well as talking about possible collaborations in the future. Thank you for the visit!
