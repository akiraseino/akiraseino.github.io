I had the opportunity to present our work in the Robotics and Mechatronics Conference 2019 in Hiroshima (ROBOMECH 2019). First time I've ever been in Hiroshima. As usual, ROBOMECH is a great venue for demos, so we had a great time. The paper we presented evaluated the long term effect of vibrotactile guidance on learning.

As I had some hours to spare the day of arrival, I had the chance to visit Miyajima and the Itsukushima Shrine, considered one of the [3 most scenic places in Japan](https://www.japan-guide.com/e/e2250.html). It was incredible! Definitely would go there again.
