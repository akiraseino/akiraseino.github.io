Yay!

I'd like to share with you guys the good news that we managed to secure a grant for our research line in Vibrotactile Actuation for Sports Training. I had the opportunity of attending the Award Ceremony in Kyoto. It was very cool and very formal, and had the opportunity to discuss with key players from the Industry about the possible applications and future work of our research. 

Additionally, going to Kyoto is always a pleasure. I fortunately had a few hours the day after the Award Ceremony to give a quick walk around the city. I decided to go to Ninenzaka and its surroundings, as it's close to the station and I didn't have much time. It was a warm day with perfect weather.

Here's a look of the ceremony!
