Great IROS follow-up!
------

Right after the conference was over, we had the opportunity to attend one of the largest International Robot Exhibitions, [ROBOTWORLD](http://eng.robotworld.or.kr/), at Kintex Exhibition Hall, Korea. The IROS staff organized some buses to take those who wanted to attend the exhibition to the venue.

Needless to say, it was massive. There were booths for most robotics companies, ranging from industrial robots from robotic pets and even robotic fishes! There were some great competitions going on, as well as impressive demos from companies all around the world. 

Here's me next to a huge mecha!
